# remoteimageanalysis
## Combining DMSP and VIIRS image composites into a timeseries to aid with image analysis.

The files can be run on local in a Jupyter Notebook.

The aim is to help with analysis of economic activity in a certain region in the south of Pakistan over a very long period of time.

The different files (1 - 4) show the progress made on each analysis. With each analysis, feedback was recieved and 
incooperated into a later version (feedback from 1 was added into 2).  Most of the code is commnented so it shuold help
with understanding what's going on.

The analysis is not yet complete.
